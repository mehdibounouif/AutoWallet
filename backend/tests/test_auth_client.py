"""Contract tests for the require_client auth hop (app/core/auth_client.py).

The middleware takes the caller's Authorization header, POSTs it to the
external authorization service, and maps the answer:

    service says    ->  endpoint returns
    --------------      ----------------
    200 allowed     ->  request proceeds
    401             ->  401  Invalid or expired token
    403             ->  403  Client access forbidden
    anything else   ->  503  Authorization service error
    outage/timeout  ->  503  Authorization service unavailable

The fake service (the `authorization_service` fixture, conftest.py) lets
each test script one of those answers. The REAL middleware code runs in
every test — only the network hop is replaced.

Sections:
    1. Local guard behavior   (what happens before the service is called)
    2. Status mapping         (service answer -> endpoint status)
    3. Request contract       (what the middleware sends to the service)
    4. Real-service behavior  (acceptance tests for open findings)

Report-only findings referenced below (owners hold the fixes):
    #11  hardcoded AUTHORIZATION_URL        (auth_client.py)
    #12  backend JWT missing `role` claim   (HOMIE)
    #13  authorize route missing leading slash (ZRAY9A)
    #14  ADMIN missing client:access        (ZRAY9A)
