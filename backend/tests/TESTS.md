# Backend test suite — developer guide

Who this is for: **testers** running the suite and **backend devs** reviewing
or extending it. Owner: ZAKARIA (QA). If a test here fails and this document
doesn't make the reason obvious, that's a documentation bug — tell me.

---

## 1. How to run

```bash
cd backend
./venv/bin/pytest -q          # expected: 105 passed, 1 xfailed (nothing red)
./venv/bin/pytest tests/test_transactions.py -q   # one file
./venv/bin/pytest "tests/test_auth_client.py::test_auth_service_403_propagates_as_403"  # one test
```

- No server, no database server, no Redis, no bank simulator, no
  authorization service, no AI provider, no SMTP server needed — see §2
  (fake infrastructure).
- Current baseline: **105 passed, 1 xfailed**. The generation-1 findings
  (#10 GET leg, #12 role claim) are FIXED (12269aa). One finding is OPEN
  and tracked by an xfail-strict acceptance test: **#15** (AI routes
  bypass the gateway hop — see §4).

## 2. The design rule: REAL code, FAKE infrastructure

Every test executes the application's real code paths. What is replaced is
only the outside world, via fixtures in `conftest.py`:

| Fixture (autouse unless noted) | Replaces | How |
|---|---|---|
| `setup_test_db` | real Postgres/SQLite file | in-memory SQLite, created once per session |
| `db_session` | real DB session | transaction per test, rolled back — tests can't pollute each other |
| `fake_redis` | real Redis | fakeredis with Lua (the lock uses Lua) and `decode_responses=True` — mirroring the PRODUCTION client in app/core/redis_client.py. Patched in EACH module holding its own imported reference |
| `no_background_scheduler` | the 60s APScheduler poller | `scheduler.start` no-op'd — no background threads racing tests |
| `poller_uses_test_db` (opt-in) | poller's own session factory | points the poller at THIS test's rolled-back session |
| `authorization_service` | the external authorization service (port 3000) | respx intercepts the middleware's HTTP call at the transport layer — no network, ever |
| `ai_provider` (opt-in) | the Gemini/OpenAI-compatible provider (app/ai) | respx intercepts provider.py's HTTP; the base URL is repointed at a fake host per test — no test ever reaches a real LLM |
| `gdpr_email` (opt-in) | the SMTP server (app/gdpr emails) | `send_email` is replaced by an in-memory outbox; tests read the 6-digit codes from it |
| `client` | a running server | FastAPI TestClient + dependency override to the in-memory DB |
| `test_user`, `auth_headers` (opt-in) | a registered user | creates the user + 5 wallets + 4 rules, issues a real production-style JWT |

**If you add a module that imports `redis_client` directly**, you must add it
to `fake_redis` — `from X import Y` copies the reference at import time, so
patching only the core module changes nothing for importers.

### The authorization_service seam (the most load-bearing fixture)

`require_client` (app/core/auth_client.py) POSTs every guarded request to
`http://api-gateway:3000/api/authorize` (the seam imports the middleware's own
`AUTHORIZATION_URL` — the URL can never desync again). The seam answers
instead, with a per-test script:

| Mode | What the fake service does |
|---|---|
| *(default)* `.respond(200)` | allows everything — business-logic tests just need the guard open |
| `.respond(401 / 403 / 404 / 500)` | script a fixed answer; tests the middleware's mapping |
| `.refuse()` | connection refused (service down) |
| `.timeout()` | hangs past the middleware's 3s timeout |
| `.realish()` | decodes the JWT with the shared secret and enforces a `role` claim — behaves like the REAL service |

Every call the middleware makes is recorded (`authorization_service.calls`)
so tests can assert the request contract too.

## 3. Test inventory — file by file

### `tests/test_auth.py` — registration, login, /me, 2FA (15 tests)

| Test | Scenario → Expected |
|---|---|
| `test_register_new_user` | valid signup → 201, response echoes identity fields |
| `test_register_response_leaks_no_password` | valid signup → body has no `password` / `hashed_password` |
| `test_register_duplicate_email_fails` | same email twice → 201 then 400 "already exists" |
| `test_register_duplicate_bank_account_fails` | same bank id, two users → 201 then 400 "already linked" |
| `test_register_invalid_email_rejected` | malformed email → 422 |
| `test_register_short_password_rejected` | 3-char password → 422 |
| `test_register_provisions_wallets_and_rules` | fresh signup → DB holds exactly 5 wallets + 4 rules |
| `test_login_success_returns_token` | correct credentials → 200 + bearer token |
| `test_login_wrong_password_rejected` | wrong password → 401 |
| `test_login_error_does_not_reveal_which_part_is_wrong` | wrong password vs unknown email → IDENTICAL 401 message (anti-enumeration) |
| `test_me_with_valid_token` | /me + valid JWT → 200 with the user's email |
| `test_me_without_token_rejected` | /me, no header → 401 |
| `test_me_with_garbage_token_rejected` | /me, fake JWT → 401, no crash |
| `test_2fa_full_flow` | setup → verify → login (no code / wrong code / fresh code) → 2FA mandatory only after verify |
| `test_2fa_setup_requires_login` | 2FA setup anonymous → 401 |

### `tests/test_transactions.py` — payments, wallet split, integrity (7 tests)

| Test | Scenario → Expected |
|---|---|
| `test_transaction_updates_wallets` | board's 8,500 example → DB shows rent 3500 / tax 750 / savings 637.5 / free 3612.5 |
| `test_transaction_recorded_with_status_and_timestamps` | valid payment → Transaction row: processed, timestamped, correct amount |
| `test_duplicate_reference_rejected_and_balances_unchanged` | same reference twice → 201 then 400, and balances byte-identical (money safety) |
| `test_non_positive_amounts_rejected` | 0 and -50 → both 422 |
| `test_transactions_require_auth` | payment with no token → 401 |
| `test_transactions_scoped_to_owner` | user A pays, user B lists → B never sees A's payment (IDOR) |
| `test_conditional_rules_apply_live_through_api` | savings at cap, then payment → savings skips, its 15% flows to free |

### `tests/test_auth_client.py` — the require_client auth hop (11 tests)

The mapping contract (`service answer → endpoint status`):

| Test | Scenario → Expected |
|---|---|
| `test_missing_token_rejected_before_auth_service_is_called` | no header → 401, service NEVER called (short-circuit) |
| `test_allowed_response_lets_guarded_request_through` | service allows → 200, 5 wallets listed |
| `test_auth_service_401_propagates_as_401` | service 401 → endpoint 401 "Invalid or expired token" |
| `test_auth_service_403_propagates_as_403` | service 403 → endpoint 403 "Client access forbidden" |
| `test_auth_service_404_maps_to_503__finding13_signature` | service 404 → endpoint 503 — **what production does today** (finding #13: the service's `authorize` route is a 404) |
| `test_auth_service_500_maps_to_503` | service crash → endpoint 503, never a 500 from our side |
| `test_auth_service_outage_maps_to_503` | connection refused → 503 "Authorization service unavailable" |
| `test_auth_service_timeout_maps_to_503` | hang > 3s → 503 (same RequestError branch) |
| `test_request_shape_contract` | one guarded request → exactly one call; path `/api/authorize`; Authorization header VERBATIM; body `{"permission":"client:access"}` — the interface the service is built against |
| `test_real_service_grants_token_with_role_claim` | realish + token WITH role → 200 (the contract the backend must reach) |
| `test_real_service_accepts_backend_token_once_role_claim_exists` ⚠️ xfail | realish + REAL backend token → DESIRED 200; fails today (403): finding **#12** (owner **HOMIE**) |

### `tests/test_oauth.py` — Google OAuth + linked-account gate (13 tests)

| Test | Scenario → Expected |
|---|---|
| `test_me_stays_open_for_unlinked_oauth_user` | unlinked user + /me → 200, bank_account_id None (documented design) |
| `test_gate_blocks_wallets_for_unlinked_user` | unlinked + wallets → 403 "link a bank account" |
| `test_gate_blocks_rules_for_unlinked_user` | unlinked + rules → 403 |
| `test_link_bank_account_opens_the_gate` | link flow → 403 → 200 link → 200 wallets |
| `test_double_link_rejected` | link twice → 200 then 400 "already linked" |
| `test_link_stealing_someone_elses_bank_id_rejected` | claim another user's bank id → 400 |
| `test_link_requires_valid_body` | 2-char bank id → 422 |
| `test_link_requires_auth` | link, no token → 401 |
| `test_google_callback_bad_code_is_handled` | Google rejects forged code → clean 401 "Google rejected", no crash |
| `test_google_callback_garbage_userinfo_response` | token exchange OK, userinfo hostile → clean 401 "user info" |
| `test_transactions_gated_for_unlinked_user` | unlinked user POSTs payment → 403 — **finding #10 POST leg, FIXED** |
| `test_transaction_list_gated_for_unlinked_user` ⚠️ xfail | unlinked user GETs list → DESIRED 403; **fails today (200): finding #10 REOPENED** (owner **HOMIE**) |
| `test_oauth_user_provisioning_matches_promise` | Google-created user → DB has the same 5 wallets + 4 rules |

### `tests/test_poller.py` — the bank-simulator polling bridge (8 tests)

| Test | Scenario → Expected |
|---|---|
| `test_poller_delivers_simulator_payment_to_wallets` | simulator shows 8,500 deposit → wallets split exactly (happy path end-to-end) |
| `test_two_users_each_get_their_own_payments` | 2 users, 1 payment each → no cross-user leakage |
| `test_unknown_simulator_account_is_skipped_and_cycle_continues` | 404 for user 1 → user 2 STILL paid |
| `test_simulator_down_does_not_raise` | simulator unreachable → cycle survives, no exception |
| `test_malformed_simulator_response_crashes_cycle` | two malformed response shapes → cycle survives AND the user after the bad account is paid (finding **#5**, fixed) |
| `test_transaction_already_processed_is_not_processed_twice` | 2 cycles over same history → credited exactly ONCE (idempotency) |
| `test_reference_collision_manual_and_polled` | same reference via manual POST AND poller → credited once (duplicate check spans both doors) |
| `test_user_without_bank_account_is_never_polled` | OAuth user, no bank id → skipped BEFORE any HTTP request |

### `tests/test_rule_engine.py` — pure-function engine (16 tests)

No client, no DB — `apply_rules(money, rules, balances)` in, allocation out.

| Test | Scenario → Expected |
|---|---|
| `test_hand_traced_8500_example` | the board's canonical example + full conservation |
| `test_condition_true_savings_cap_still_saves` | savings < cap → rule fires |
| `test_condition_false_savings_cap_flows_onward` | savings ≥ cap → skipped, 15% flows to free |
| `test_condition_false_rent_already_covered` | rent full → no double lock, tax on FULL pool |
| `test_income_tier_tax_20_when_high_income` | two tax rules, opposite tiers → only first match allocates |
| `test_emergency_override_skips_tax_and_savings` | main < 500 → tax+savings skipped, everything to free |
| `test_first_payment_bonus_rule` | one-time bonus fires only on first payment |
| `test_payment_smaller_than_rent_lock` | 2,000 vs 3,500 lock → rent takes what exists, no crash |
| `test_zero_amount_allocates_nothing` / `..._negative_...` | 0 / negative → empty allocation (defense in depth for webhook paths) |
| `test_priority_order_determines_who_gets_paid_first` | rules out of order ON PURPOSE → engine sorts by priority |
| `test_rules_targeting_same_wallet_accumulate` | 2 rules → same wallet → accumulate |
| `test_unknown_condition_field_silently_skips_rule` ⚠️ documents current behavior | typo'd field → rule vanishes SILENTLY (QA warning, reported) |
| `test_unknown_condition_operator_silently_skips_rule` ⚠️ same | unsupported operator ignored silently |
| `test_malformed_rule_values_take_nothing_without_crashing` | fixed_amount=None → 0.0, no crash |
| `test_unallocated_remainder_goes_to_main_wallet` | money no rule claims → lands in main, never disappears (was xfail, PR #7 fixed) |

### `tests/test_ai.py` — the AI assistant (21 tests, 1 xfail)

Everything goes through the real routes; only the provider HTTP is
intercepted (`ai_provider` seam, conftest).

| Test | Scenario → Expected |
|---|---|
| `test_questions_under_the_limit_are_allowed` | limit 3, three questions → all allowed, no wait |
| `test_question_over_the_limit_is_refused_with_a_wait` | 4th question → refused, wait 1–61s |
| `test_refused_questions_do_not_count` | over-limit spam never grows the window (zcard stays 3) |
| `test_the_rate_limit_key_expires` | quiet user → key auto-expires inside the 60s window |
| `test_rate_limit_fails_open_when_redis_is_down` | Redis unreachable → question still answered (documented fail-open choice) |
| `test_prompt_carries_instructions_user_data_and_question` | system message = instructions + THIS user's balances/rules; question rides as user message |
| `test_prompt_never_leaks_credentials` | no password hash, no email, no 2FA secret in the prompt (the privacy page's promise, pinned) |
| `test_ai_chat_requires_login` | anonymous → 401 |
| `test_ai_requires_a_linked_bank_account` | unlinked OAuth user → 403, same gate as money endpoints |
| `test_blank_message_is_rejected` / `..._oversized_...` | "   " / 2001 chars → 422 before any provider call |
| `test_missing_key_answers_not_configured` | empty AI_API_KEY → 503 not_configured |
| `test_chat_returns_the_provider_answer` | provider 200 → the answer text verbatim |
| `test_provider_busy_maps_to_503` / `..._rejected_maps_to_502` / `..._unreachable_maps_to_503` / `..._timeout_maps_to_504` | every provider failure → the documented clean status + code |
| `test_rate_limit_blocks_the_route_after_the_limit` | 2 allowed, 3rd → 429 + Retry-After; provider called exactly twice |
| `test_stream_emits_token_events_then_done` | provider SSE → token events verbatim, then done; content-type text/event-stream |
| `test_stream_maps_provider_failure_to_an_error_event` | provider dies mid-stream → error EVENT, not a hang |
| `test_ai_routes_go_through_the_gateway_authorization_hop` ⚠️ xfail | **finding #15** — see §4 |

### `tests/test_gdpr.py` — data export + two-step account deletion (13 tests)

| Test | Scenario → Expected |
|---|---|
| `test_export_json_contains_all_data_but_no_secrets` | JSON export has profile/5 envelopes/4 rules/payments — and NEVER the password hash or 2FA secret |
| `test_export_is_scoped_to_the_requester` | user B's payment/email appear NOWHERE in user A's export |
| `test_export_works_without_a_linked_bank_account` | OAuth user without bank id → 200 (GDPR rights don't depend on product state) |
| `test_export_requires_login` | anonymous → 401 |
| `test_export_csv_is_a_zip_of_four_tables` | CSV format → zip of profile/envelopes/rules/payments, 5 wallet rows |
| `test_delete_request_emails_a_six_digit_code_and_stores_only_its_hash` | 202; email carries the code; Redis stores sha256(user:code) only, 15-min TTL |
| `test_an_immediate_second_code_request_is_refused` | instant resend → 429 + Retry-After ~60 |
| `test_email_failure_answers_503_and_clears_the_code` | SMTP down → 503 email_unavailable AND the Redis key deleted (no 15-min brute-force window) |
| `test_confirm_without_a_code_is_rejected` | no code ever requested → 400 no_code |
| `test_a_wrong_code_counts_the_tries_and_keeps_the_account` | typo → 400 wrong_code "4 tries left", account untouched |
| `test_five_wrong_codes_cancel_the_code` | 5 wrong → 429 too_many_tries; the REAL code then answers 400 no_code |
| `test_the_correct_code_deletes_the_account_and_all_its_data` | 200; user + wallets + rules + payments all gone (cascade); goodbye email sent |
| `test_redis_down_answers_503_for_deletion` | Redis unreachable → 503 unavailable — deletion never confirmed blind |

### `tests/test_concurrency.py` — the lock under real pressure (2 tests)

The Redis lock's two doors, in one file: the manual HTTP entry raced by two
REAL threads, and the poller entry meeting a lock held forever.

| Test | Scenario → Expected |
|---|---|
| `test_concurrent_payments_same_user_both_processed` | 2 payments, 2 REAL threads → both 201, wallets total = paid total, nothing lost/duplicated |
| `test_lock_held_by_another_worker_cycle_continues` | lock held forever on user 1 → cycle continues, user 2 paid (finding **#6** poller half, fixed) |

Shared helpers these files import live in `tests/helpers.py`
(`make_user`, `wallet_balances`, `mock_account`, `SIMULATOR`) — plain
support functions, NOT fixtures; fixtures stay in `conftest.py`.

## 4. The acceptance-test convention (xfail-strict) — how findings are tracked

**Cycle status: the first generation is CLOSED.** The two tracked findings
(#10 GET leg, #12 role claim, owner HOMIE) were fixed in `12269aa`; both
acceptance tests exist and pass today as plain tests, and the xfail
markers were resolved (commented out in that commit — a full delete of
the marker blocks is the preferred form, minor cleanup, see §6).

The convention stays documented here because it is the pattern for every
FUTURE finding:

```python
@pytest.mark.xfail(strict=True, reason="finding #N (owner: X): ... exact fix location ...")
```

- **xfail** = the test asserts the DESIRED (post-fix) behavior but currently
  fails, exactly because of the finding. Suite stays green for CI.
- **strict=True** = when the owner's fix lands, the test XPASSes — which
  FAILS the suite on purpose. That is the signal to: verify the fix,
  remove the marker, rename if needed, and re-run.
- Reason text always names the finding number, the owner, and the exact
  file:line of the missing fix — so whoever picks it up starts warm.

Open findings (cycle 2):

| Test | Finding | Owner | The missing fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| `test_ai_routes_go_through_the_gateway_authorization_hop` (test_ai.py) | **#15** | MTARZA | `app/ai/router.py:17` — the router is created WITHOUT `dependencies=[Depends(require_client)]`, so both AI endpoints are authenticated by local JWT only and never cross the api-gateway authorization hop like every other business router. Add the dependency (one line); the xfail test XPASSes (strict) → remove the marker and re-run. |

Closed-cycle log:

| Test | Finding | Owner | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| `test_real_service_accepts_backend_token_once_role_claim_exists` | #12 | HOMIE | `create_access_token` now emits `{"sub", "role", "exp"}` (security.py:22); verified live: token carries `role:"user"`, guarded chain answers 200 (e2e, 2026-09-28) |
| `test_transaction_list_gated_for_unlinked_user` | #10 (reopened, partial fix) | HOMIE | `list_transactions` (transactions.py:38) now `Depends(require_linked_account)`; verified by the test passing |

---

## 5. Failure triage — where to look first

| Symptom | Most likely cause | Where |
|---|---|---|
| many guarded-endpoint tests fail with 503 | the seam fixture was removed/broken, or auth_client's URL changed | `conftest.py` seam, `app/core/auth_client.py` (#11: URL is hardcoded) |
| one test fails with an assertion naming a finding | that's an acceptance test telling you a finding is still open (or just got fixed and the xfail needs removing) | §4 table |
| `fake_redis` KeyError / lock errors | a new module imports `redis_client` and isn't patched | `conftest.py` `fake_redis` |
| poller tests time out | `no_background_scheduler` removed, or `poller_uses_test_db` not requested in the signature | `conftest.py` |
| everything fails at import | `.env` missing (settings hard-requires GOOGLE_* dummies — finding #9) | `backend/.env` |

---

## 6. Conventions for new tests

1. **One scenario per test**; docstring = `SCENARIO: / EXPECTED:` (two lines).
2. **File sections** with banner comments; keep related tests in their file's
   section, not in new files without a reason.
3. **Findings are report-only**: never fix someone else's code in the test
   suite; write an xfail-strict acceptance test naming owner + file (§4).
4. The fake infrastructure stays in `conftest.py`; tests should read as
   scenarios, not as plumbing.
5. Run the full suite before proposing a PR: `./venv/bin/pytest -q` must show
   the documented baseline (§1) — a red suite is not a reviewable PR.
