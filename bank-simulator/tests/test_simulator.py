"""Tests for the bank simulator (bank-simulator/main.py).

The simulator is the fake bank the backend polls every 60s. Its two
endpoints are simple and stateless-ish (in-memory), so these tests use
the same TestClient style as the backend suite — but with one twist:
the simulator keeps its state in a module-level dict, so each test
resets it by hand to stay isolated.
